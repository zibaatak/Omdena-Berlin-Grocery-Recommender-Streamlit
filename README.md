# Omdena Berlin Project - Recommender for Groceries in Berlin

In this Omdena Project, I built a content-based recommendation engine utilizing the power of Named Entity Recognition (NER). 
You can find the link to the recommender below! Please enjoy and have fun!

## Future Opportunities 
Another contributor in this project used sentence transformers which showed superior performance in more complex queries like "wine for dinner".
The next steps in this recommendation engine would be to combine NER and sentence transformers for more accurate results which will lead to higher 
user satisfaction.
